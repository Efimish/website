# Website
A simple frontend made using `Svelte` and `TailWind` + `DaisyUI`\
for another project [`rust-webserver`](../../../rust-webserver).\
It is not currently working, needs reworking.

### To-do list
- [x] Add functions and types to reach endpoints
- [ ] Add pages to access everything you need
- [ ] Add error handling (like username is too short etc...)
- [x] Restrict unauthorized users to reach anything but login / register pages
- [ ] Make it build to run on GitHub Pages (use static adapter and add build actions script)
- [ ] Add custom domain
- [ ] Make it look better
